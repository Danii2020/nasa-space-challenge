## 🚀 About Us

We are **Excelsior**, a visionary team participating in the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024**. Driven by our passion for technology and the environment, we built **Kayabot**, an app designed to raise awareness about the impact of climate change on our planet.

**Team Info:**

- 🌟 **Team Name**: Excelsior
- 🛠 **Company**: Kayatech
- 🌐 **Mission**: Use technology to transform how we understand and tackle global environmental challenges.
- 🤼 **Members**: Daniel Erazo, Juan Diego Vizcaíno and Francis Villacrés Merchán.

## 🌱 What is Kayabot?

**Kayabot** is a prototype app that transports users to a near future where Earth has been devastated by climate change. Through immersive storytelling, users will explore:

- 📊 **CO2 emissions** over the decades, visualized interactively.
- 🌡 **Global temperatures** and their rise over time.
- 🌍 **Real-time data** provided by NASA, showing the impact of climate change in different regions of the world.

### 🎯 Our Goal

We aim to **raise awareness** and educate people about the devastating effects of climate change in a way that motivates them to act. **Kayabot** doesn’t just present numbers and graphs; it tells a story about how our planet could change if we don’t act now.

## 💻 How It Works

- Users explore different layers of interactive data.
- Comparisons of current emissions and temperatures are shown alongside historical data.
- The app allows users to visualize the **future destruction of Earth** if no action is taken.
- **Real NASA data** is integrated into the interactive experience.

## 🌟 What Makes Kayabot Unique?

- **Interactivity**: Users don’t just see the data; they engage with it in a dynamic, visual interface.
- **Engaging Storytelling**: Kayabot narrates a visual story that makes the urgency of climate change real and tangible.
- **NASA Data**: We use accurate, reliable information that demonstrates the impact on our planet.

## 🤝 Acknowledgements

This project wouldn’t have been possible without the support of:

- **NASA Space Apps Challenge** for providing a platform to innovate.
- **Our incredible team of developers, designers, and storytellers** for their hard work and dedication.

We hope Kayabot inspires others to care for the planet! 🌍💚
